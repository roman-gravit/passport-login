### EJS 

EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. 
No religiousness about how to organize things. 
No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.


### NODEMON

nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes 
in the directory are detected nodemon does not require any additional changes to your code or method of development. 
nodemon is a replacement wrapper for node. To use nodemon, replace the word node on the command line when executing your script. 


### PASSPORT

Passport is Express-compatible authentication middleware for Node.js.

Passport's sole purpose is to authenticate requests, which it does through an extensible set of plugins known as strategies. 
Passport does not mount routes or assume any particular database schema, which maximizes flexibility and allows application-level 
decisions to be made by the developer. The API is simple: you provide Passport a request to authenticate, and Passport provides hooks 
for controlling what occurs when authentication succeeds or fails.


### PASSPORT-LOCAL

Passport strategy for authenticating with a username and password.

This module lets you authenticate using a username and password in your Node.js applications. 
By plugging into Passport, local authentication can be easily and unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework 
that supports Connect-style middleware, including Express.
